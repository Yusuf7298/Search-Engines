Report on ARM Architecture
1. Register Organization
The ARM architecture is designed with a highly efficient register organization that adapts
to different processor modes, such as User, FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request), IRQ (Interrupt
Request), Supervisor, and others. Below are the key aspects of its register structure:
1.1 Number of Registers
ARM processors typically include 37 registers in total:
•
•
31 general-purpose registers (R0-R30): These are used for arithmetic, logical
operations, and data storage.
6 status registers: Include the CPSR (Current Program Status Register) and
SPSRs (Saved Program Status Registers) for exception handling.
However, only 16 registers (R0-R15) are visible at any given time in most operating
modes. The visibility depends on the mode the processor is currently executing in.
